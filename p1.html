<p><b>When people browse a website, they want easy navigation, attractive design, and relevant content. Not only these but there are other few
requirements that would help you to build a catchy website.</b></p>
<p>People are becoming more selective about the time they spend online. With the average adult spending almost 6 hours per day on digital media, people are becoming wary of the internet's impact on their lives.

Between browsing the internet for leisure and using it at work, people spend most of their day online. Studies show that excessive screen time can be detrimental for adults. Social media websites, in particular, are facing backlash for their habit-forming design and disruption of quality, in-person social connections.
