<h2>1. Easy Navigation is the Most Useful Website Feature</h2>
<p>A website that’s easy to navigate provides users with faster, more efficient access to content they want.

People prefer a website with a clear menu structure that makes it easy to maneuver between pages. <br>
<br>Amazon is known for being easy to navigate, despite its high volume of content.</p>

</p>
<p>On its homepage, Amazon presents options for users to navigate and explore the site. By making menus easy to access and darkening the rest of the screen, people can focus on shopping categories and bypass the tempting offerings on the home screen.</p>

<p>Businesses should follow Amazon’s example and prioritize functionality and navigation for their users. Not doing so could mean losing potential customers.</p>
