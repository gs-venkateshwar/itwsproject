<h2>3. Website Content That Establishes Brand Authority</h2>
<p>People visit websites to access content. Accurate content tailored to a specific audience establishes brand authority for businesses.<br><br>
There are three main types of content:
<ul>
<li>Basic Company Information: A company “About Us” page or external links to a company’s social media profiles</li>
<li>Product Descriptions and Visuals: Text or images that showcase a company’s main offerings</li>
<li>Blogs: Long-form written or video </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Because content is a priority for most people, companies must understand what people want to watch or read to understand their intent. User intent is a digital marketing term that refers to the purpose of people’s search queries online.</p>
<p>Instead of designing around a blank space where content will be, help your UX team blend design and content by sharing a sample blog post or product page.
<br>
To hold users’ attention in present times, UX designers need to map users’ journeys and incorporate content in a website's design phase. This will make sure content is relevant and useful for website visitors.</p>
