<h2>4. Product Visuals and Descriptions Are Equally Important</h2>
<p>People think product/services visuals and descriptions are equally useful when they visit a company’s website.</p>
<p>Steve Vest is the senior user experience designer at Small Footprint, a software development company in Winston-Salem, N.C. He says that using unmarked design space, or “white space,” can help companies present both written and visual content effectively.
<br><br>
“We use white space to help the user focus on what we need them to see,” Vest said. “We keep the images as large as the design allows and then use white space to separate things so that the layout is easily scanned.”
<br>
<br>
Companies should apply this approach to both the mobile and desktop versions of their websites.
<br><br>
“On a mobile phone, we try to utilize a single image in a column,” Vest said. “On larger screens, we may expand this to three or four rows and columns. We try not to overtax the user’s senses.”</p>
<p><em>Most users are browsing on mobile, so it’s important for businesses to develop mobile-responsive websites that don’t overwhelm the user.</em></p>
<p>For example, Amazon home page on mobile only has one image, a menu bar in the top left corner for easy navigation, and a large form where users easily access the content they want on mobile</p>
<img src="p5.png" alt="amazon mob" style="width:500px;height:800px;"><br>
<p>Because descriptions and visuals of products and services are equally important to users, companies must make both elements stand out on the page with clever web design.</p>
