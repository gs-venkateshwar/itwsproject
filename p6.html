<h2>5. Social Media as an Extension of a Company’s Website</h2>
<p>Links to social media accounts are important for people browsing a company’s website.</p>
<p>
Social media account links fall below descriptions and visuals among users’ favorite website features but above “About Us” pages and company blogs.
<br><br>

This preference for social media may be due to the immediacy offered by platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Company social media profiles typically offer the same information as an “About Us” page on a more accessible medium.
<br><br>
It’s more convenient for users to learn about companies and products on social media. Companies are only going to use a social media platform if it’ll help their business grow. Their presence on social media depends on the industry.
<br><br>
Businesses should use social media to connect informally with their users. Content on a company’s social media page should be just as current and useful as the main website.
<br><br>
Social media integrations also provide valuable social proof, allowing users to verify a company’s legitimacy across platforms. Icons for Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or Instagram tell people where they can find the company on social media.
